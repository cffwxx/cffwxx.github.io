Hello! I am Chi-Fong Wong, a physicist, currently an assistant professor in the Faculty of Data Science at City University of Macau.

I primarily work on particle physics phenomenology, focusing on neutrinos (about the origin of masses and mixings) and dark matter (about its nature and cosmological impact). Additionally, I have also dedicated some time before to simulations and analysis of the Martian atmosphere, particularly regarding its global circulation and intriguing seasonal dust storms.

Recently, I have been paying more attention to utilizing machine learning and data analysis techniques on various topics across physics and finance. From a physicist's perspective, the sciences of both fields are the same.

## Recent Research Interests

* Theory (High Energy Physics, Cosmology, Physics for AI)
* Data (finance, Astrophysics)
