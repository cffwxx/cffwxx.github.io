Hello! I am Chi-Fong Wong, an assistant professor in the Faculty of Data Science at City University of Macau.

## Research Interests

### Machine Learning X Physics

Recent advancements of machine learning have provided a rich toolbox for physical science, particularly in dealing with complicated phenomena and datasets. Currently, I am studying machine learning applications in following topics:

* Particle collider experiments.
* Data-driven inference of dynamic equations.
* Mars' atmosphere simulation and data analysis.

### High Energy Physics

High energy physics studies the most fundamental structure and interactions of nature and is inevitably related to cosmology. I work on Beyond Standard Model physics, aiming to address:

* The flavour problem, especially neutrino mass and mixing.
* Cosmological mysteries, including dark matter, dark energy, and gravitational wave.

## To students

You are welcome to join me in the aforementioned research topics.

* Students in computer science and data science are particularly suitable for topics relevant to machine learning. It would be a great opportunity to experience the frontier of natural science research.
* Futhermore, **quantitative finance** especially **algorithmic trading** is one of my intellectual interests. You are welcome to join me in building an automated trading system, designing a profitable trading strategy, or uncovering hidden dynamics behind financial markets.
