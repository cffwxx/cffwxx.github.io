Hello! I am Chi-Fong Wong, an assistant professor in the Faculty of Data Science at City University of Macau.

## Research Interests

### High Energy Physics

I have been working on High Energy Physics since the beginning of my career, mainly on theoretical and phenomenological aspects about origin of neutrino masses, Dark Matter, and flavor puzzle. More topics related to Cosmology such as Dark Energy, Inflation, and Gravitational Wave may also be considered.

### Machine Learning X Physics

Recent advancements of Machine Learning have provided a rich toolbox for studies of physical science, particularly in dealing with complicated datasets and phenomena. I am interested in applying Machine Learning techniques in:

* particle colliders experiments
* astrophysical observations
* atmospheric science of Mars
* discovering equations from data

## To students

You are very welcome to join me in aforementioned research topics. It would be optimal if you have strong background in mathematics, physics, or astronomy. However, you can still contribute effectively to these topics even with purely CS/DS background.

**Futhermore**, although not a primary research focus, quantitative finance especially algorithmic trading is one of my intellectual interests. Therefore, you are also welcome to join me in building up an **automated trading system**, designing a beneficial **trading strategy**, or discovering **hidden connection between financial markets and physics**.
