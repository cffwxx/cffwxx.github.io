Hello! I am Chi-Fong Wong, a physicist, currently an assistant professor in the Faculty of Data Science at City University of Macau.

I primarily work on particle physics phenomenology, focusing on neutrinos (about the origin of masses and mixings) and dark matter (about its nature and cosmological impact). Additionally, I have also dedicated some time before to simulations and analysis of the Martian atmosphere, particularly regarding its global circulation and intriguing seasonal dust storms. Recently, I have been paying more attention to utilizing machine learning and data analysis techniques on various topics across physics and finance. From a physicist's perspective, the sciences of both fields are the same.

## Recent research Interests

### Machine Learning Applications

* High energy physics and cosmological data, such as collider experiments and astronomical observations.
* Data-driven inference of differential equation in complex system, such as atmosphere.
* Data analysis on finance market, such as stock price and company's status.

### High Energy Physics

High energy physics studies the most fundamental structure and interactions of nature and is inevitably related to cosmology. I work on Beyond Standard Model physics, aiming to address:

* The flavour problem, especially neutrino mass and mixing.
* Cosmological mysteries, including dark matter, dark energy, and gravitational wave.
